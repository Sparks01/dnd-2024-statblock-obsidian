### Traits
***Hold Breath.*** The a-mi-kuk can hold its breath for 30 minutes.

***Fear of Fire.*** The a-mi-kuk is afraid of fire, and it wonât move toward any fiery or burning objects. If presented forcefully with a flame, or if it is dealt fire damage, the a-mi-kuk must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn. After it has been frightened by a specific source of fire (such as the burning hands spell), the a-mi-kuk canât be frightened by that same source again for 24 hours.

***Icy Slime.*** The a-mi-kukâs body is covered in a layer of greasy, ice-cold slime that grants it the benefits of freedom of movement. In addition, a creature that touches the a-mi-kuk or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) cold damage from the freezing slime. A creature grappled by the a-mi-kuk takes this damage at the start of each of its turns.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The a-mi-kuk makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its grasping claw.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.

***Grasping Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). The a-mi-kuk has two grasping claws, each of which can grapple only one target at a time.

***Strangle.*** The a-mi-kuk strangles one creature grappled by it. The target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage, canât breathe, speak, or cast spells, and begins suffocating. On a success, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and is no longer grappled. Until this strangling grapple ends (escape DC 16), the target takes 13 (3d8) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. The a-mi-kuk can strangle up to two Medium or smaller targets or one Large target at a time.
