### Traits
***Armored Berserker.*** The pain caused by the iron plates bolted to its body keep it on the edge of madness. Whenever it starts its turn with 60 hp or fewer roll a d6. On a 6 it goes berserk. While berserk has resistance to B/P/S damage. On each of its turns while berserk it attacks nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack attacks an object with preference for object smaller than itself. Once it goes berserk continues to do so until destroyed or regains all its hp.

***Dual Shields.*** Carries two shields which together give it a +3 bonus to its AC (included in its AC).

***Poor Depth Perception.*** Has disadvantage on attack rolls vs. a target more than 30' away from it.
