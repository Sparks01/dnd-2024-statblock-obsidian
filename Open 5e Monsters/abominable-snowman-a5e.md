### Traits
***Camouflage.*** The yeti has advantage on Stealth checks made to hide in snowy terrain.

***Fire Fear.*** When the yeti takes fire damage, it is rattled until the end of its next turn.

***Storm Sight.*** The yetis vision is not obscured by weather conditions.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The yeti uses Chilling Gaze and makes two claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.

***Chilling Gaze (Gaze).*** One creature within 30 feet that is not immune to cold damage makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure  the creature takes 10 (3d6) cold damage and is paralyzed for 1 minute. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  ending the effect on a success. If a creatures saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it  it is immune to any Chilling Gaze for 24 hours.
