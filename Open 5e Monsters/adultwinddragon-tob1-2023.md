### Traits
***Freedom of Movement.*** The dragon ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects canât reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Storm Sight.*** The dragon can see through areas obscured by fog, mist, clouds, or precipitation.

***Whirling Winds.*** Gale force winds rage around the dragonâs body. Ranged weapon attack rolls against the dragon have disadvantage.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The wind dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragonâs choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creatureâs saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragonâs Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Tempest Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales a blast of stormy wind in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage and 27 (6d8) lightning damage and is pushed up to 30 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isnât pushed or knocked prone. Unprotected flames, such as torches, in the area are extinguished, and protected flames, such as those in lanterns, have a 75 percent chance of being extinguished.

### Legendary Actions
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatureâs turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a Tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
