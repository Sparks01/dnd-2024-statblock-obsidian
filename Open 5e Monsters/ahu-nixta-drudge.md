### Traits
***Clockwork Encasement.*** The creature within the machine is a somewhat shapeless mass, both protected and given concrete manipulators by its armor. The clockwork armor has a few manipulators that the ahu-nixta can use to attack or to interact with objects outside of the armor. Unlike other ahu-nixta, the drudge canât live outside its armor and dies when its armor is reduced to 0 hp.

***Immutable Form.*** The drudgeâs clockwork armor is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form, as is the creature that controls it as long as the ahu-nixta remains within the armor.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The ahu-nixtaâs innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 11, +3 to hit with spell attacks). The ahunixta can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: fire bolt  (1d10)
1/day: fear

### Actions
***Whirring Blades.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.
