***Amphibious.*** Can breathe air and water.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** Choose to succeed failed save.

***Magic Resistance.*** Advantage: spell/magic effect saves.

***Magic Weapons.*** Weapon attacks are magical.

***Offering of Flesh.*** Can spend 1 min carefully detaching part or all of one of its 100-foot-long tentacles dealing no damage to itself. Tentacle contains a magic-imbued fleshy hook and enough meat for 25 rations (if part of a tentacle) or 50 rations (if a full tentacle) if properly preserved. Fleshy hook remains imbued with magic for 4 hrs or until a creature eats it. A creature that eats magic-infused fleshy hook regains 50 hp then it is cured of blindness deafness and all diseases or restores all lost limbs (creatureâs choice). Limb restoration effect works like regenerate spell. Hookâs magic works only if the akkorokamui offered it willingly.

***Siege Monster.*** Double damage to objects/structures.

If creature is willing it is pulled up to 10 ft. closer to akkorokamui and akkorokamui becomes new attack target. If creature isnât willing this reaction fails.

Each creature grappled by akkorokamui must make DC 17 Str save or take 12 (2d6+5) bludgeoning damage.
