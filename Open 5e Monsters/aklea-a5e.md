### Traits
***Divine Grace.*** If the empyrean makes a saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, it takes no damage on a success and half damage on a failure. Furthermore, while wearing medium armor, the empyrean adds its full Dexterity bonus to its Armor Class (already included).

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The empyreans innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 23). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: At will: charm person, command, telekinesis, 3/day: flame strike, hold monster, lightning bolt, 1/day: commune, greater restoration, heroes feast, plane shift (self only, can't travel to or from the Material Plane)

### Actions
***Maul.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 38 (8d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) radiant damage  and the target makes a DC 25 Strength saving throw. On a failure  the target is pushed up to 30 feet away and knocked prone.

***Lightning Bolt (3rd-Level; V, S).*** A bolt of lightning 5 feet wide and 100 feet long arcs from the empyrean. Each creature in the area makes a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw  taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

***Flame Strike (5th-Level; V, S).*** A column of divine flame fills a 10-foot-radius  40-foot-high cylinder within 60 feet. Creatures in the area make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw  taking 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

***Hold Monster (5th-Level; V, S, Concentration).*** One creature the empyrean can see within 60 feet makes a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  ending the effect on a success.

### Bonus Actions
***Immortal Form.*** The empyrean magically changes its size between Gargantuan and Medium. While Medium, the empyrean has disadvantage on Strength checks. Its statistics are otherwise unchanged.

### Legendary Actions
***The empyrean can take 1 legendary action.*** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Attack.*** The empyrean makes a weapon attack.

***Cast Spell.*** The empyrean casts a spell. The empyrean can't use this option if it has cast a spell since the start of its last turn.

***Fly.*** The empyrean flies up to half its fly speed.

***Shout (Recharge 5-6).*** Each creature within 120 feet that can hear the empyrean makes a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 24 (7d6) thunder damage and is stunned until the end of the empyreans next turn. On a success, a creature takes half damage.
