### Traits
***Cloak of Swarms.*** Akyishigal emits a cloud of flying, stinging insects from his mouth, eyes, and tears in his skin that spreads out in a 5-foot radius from him. At the start of each of his turns, Akyishigal chooses whether this cloak is active.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Akyishigal fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Akyishigal has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Akyishigal makes four Claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.

***Call Spawn (1/Day).*** Akyishigal magically calls one spawn of Akyishigal. The spawn arrives in 1d4 rounds, acting as an ally of Akyishigal and obeying its telepathic commands. The spawn remains for 1 hour, until Akyishigal dies, or until Akyishigal dismisses it as a bonus action.
