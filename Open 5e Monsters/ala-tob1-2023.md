### Traits
***Flyby.*** The ala doesnât provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemyâs reach.

***Poisonous Flesh.*** The alaâs poison infuses its flesh. A creature that touches the ala or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) poison damage.

***Storm’s Strength.*** If the ala is outside and an electrical storm is within 1 mile of it, creatures have disadvantage on their saving throws against the alaâs Lightningâs Kiss.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The ala makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

***Lightning’s Kiss (Recharge 5–6).*** The ala launches a bolt of lightning at up to three targets it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
