### Traits
***Bloodthirsty.*** An alabroza must drink at least 1 pint of fresh blood or milk every 24 hrs or it suffers one level of exhaustion. Each pint of blood or milk the alabroza drinks removes one level of exhaustion.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Two Talons attacks or one Talons attack and one Draining Fangs attack.

***Draining Fangs.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, 5 ft., one creature,. 6 (1d8+2) piercing damage and the alabroza attaches to the target. While attached the alabroza doesnât attack. Instead at the start of each of the alabrozaâs turns the target loses 6 (1d8+2) hp due to blood loss. The alabroza can detach itself by spending 5 ft. of its movement. It does so after the target is reduced to 0 hp. A creature including the target can use its action to detach the alabroza.

***Talons.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, 5 ft., one creature,. 5 (1d6+2) slashing damage.
