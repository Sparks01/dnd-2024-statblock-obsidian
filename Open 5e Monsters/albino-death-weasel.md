### Traits
***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The weasel has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

***Pounce.*** If the weasel moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the weasel can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage. The target is also grappled (escape DC 13) if it is a Medium or smaller creature and the albino weasel isn't already grappling a creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the albino death weasel can't claw another target.

***Musk Spray (Recharge 5-6).*** The weasel unleashes a spray of foul musk in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
