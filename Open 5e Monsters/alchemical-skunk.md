### Traits
***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The alchemical skunk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

***Magic Resistance.*** The alchemical skunk has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The alchemical skunk uses its Alchemical Spray. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

***Alchemical Spray.*** The alchemical skunk raises its tail and sprays an alchemical mixture. The skunk is immune to its own spray effects and to the spray effects of other alchemical skunks. Roll a d6 to determine the skunkâs spray.
1. Pleasant Mist. The skunk produces a rosy mist. Each creature within 10 feet of the skunk must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be charmed until the end of its next turn.
2. Shrinking Cloud. The skunk releases a yellow gas. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be reduced as if targeted by the enlarge/reduce spell for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
3. Laughing Gas. The skunk emits a sparkling orange cloud. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated as it laughs for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
4. Blinding Spray. The skunk shoots a stream of a green fluid. Each creature in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute, or until the creature uses an action to wipe its eyes.
5. Sleeping Fog. The skunk sprays a sweet-smelling blue fog. Each creature within 10 feet of the skunk must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
6. Poison Fog. The skunk excretes a foul-smelling purple fog around itself until the start of its next turn. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the skunk must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.
