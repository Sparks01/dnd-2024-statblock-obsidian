### Traits
***Apothecary.*** At the start of each of the kobold alchemistâs turns, the alchemist chooses one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. The alchemist has resistance to that damage type until the start of its next turn.

***Pack Tactics.*** The kobold has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the koboldâs allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isnât incapacitated.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The kobold makes two Alchemical Dagger or Alchemical Bolt attacks.

***Alchemical Dagger.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) damage of the type determined by Apothecary.

***Alchemical Bolt.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) damage of the type determined by Apothecary.

***Alchemical Vapors (Recharge 6).*** The kobold alchemist releases alchemical vapors pleasing to draconic senses and unpleasant to all others. Each creature that isnât a dragonborn or kobold within 15 feet of the alchemist must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each dragonborn and kobold within 15 feet of the alchemist has resistance to damage of the type determined by Apothecary for 1 minute.

***Explosive Flask (Recharge 5–6).*** The kobold alchemist throws a flask of volatile substances at a point it can see within 30 feet of it. The flask explodes, and each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) damage of the type determined by Apothecary and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isnât poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
