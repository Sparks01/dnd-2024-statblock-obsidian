### Traits
***Plant Camouflage.*** Advantage on Dex (Stealth) checks it makes in any terrain with ample obscuring plant life.

***Tearful Stench.*** Each creature other than an alliumite within 5 ft. of alliumite when it takes damage: DC 14 Con save or be blinded until start of creatureâs next turn. On a successful save creature is immune to Tearful Stench of all alliumites for 1 min.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Two Thorny Rapiers or one Thorny Rapier and one Grappelvine Whip.

***Thorny Rapier.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 8 (1d8+4) piercing damage + 3 (1d6) slashing damage.

***Grapplevine Whip.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, 10 ft., one target, 9 (2d4+4) slashing damage. If target is holding a weapon it must make DC 14 Str save or drop the weapon. If it is holding more than one weapon it drops only one.

### Reactions
***Grapplevine Escape.*** When a creature rapscallion can see hits it with melee attack can use its whip to swing up to 20' away from attacker provided nearby terrain includes a feature it can use to swing (branch chandelier ledge mast railing or similar). This movement doesnât provoke opportunity attacks.

***Pungent Retort.*** When a creature rapscallion can see within 60' of it starts its turn or casts a spell rapscallion issues forth a string of insults cleverly crafted to make a foe cry. If it can hear the rapscallion target: DC 14 Wis save or sob uncontrollably until start of rapscallionâs next turn. A sobbing creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls and must make DC 14 Con save to cast a spell that requires spellcaster to see its target. Spellcaster doesnât lose the spell slot on a failure.
